# hello-world
This is my first step for GitHub!
I am a beginner in Python, where I am eager to learn these new fundamental languages and skills to understand the development of computer programming.
In addition, my passion for Computer Science comes from my love of video games and how it attracts people from all ages in order to create a wonderful and passionate community.
